This project is a **Hit Counter**, inspired by the need for a simple, customizable visitor badge for websites and repositories.

## Why was this made?

The popular [gjbae1212/hit-counter](https://github.com/gjbae1212/hit-counter), which many developers relied on for badge-based hit/visitor counters, became discontinued and is no longer available. This project was created as a modern, reliable, and self-hostable alternative.

## How To Use
You can generate the badge through [Hit Counter](https://hits.devcomma.com).
